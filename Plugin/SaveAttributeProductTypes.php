             *
             * The Magento_Catalog:etc/product_types.xsd does not validate that product type names do not contain
             * whitespace or consist of only whitespace. Therefore, while highly unlikely, it is technically possible
             * for a product type name to be declared as a single space - meaning the trick below will result in the
             * attribute being applied to that product type.
             *
             * If you somehow find yourself in this position:
             *     1. I'm sorry that you have to work on a project where somebody has defined a product type like this.
             *        I can only imagine some of the other horrors you're dealing with.
             *     2. The fix to work around this is to simply change this single space to be any non-falsey value that
             *        is also NOT a defined product type.
